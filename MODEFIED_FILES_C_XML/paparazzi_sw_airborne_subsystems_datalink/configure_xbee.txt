1.Use XCTU, choose "COORDINATOR API MODE" and write to the module.
2.Set the "PAN ID" to a random number within 64 bits (the PAN ID must be the same between coordinator and router/end device).
3.Set the 64-bit destination address of coordinator as "0x000000000000FFFF" for boardcasting use.
4.Set baud rate to 57600.
5.Write to the module.

Configure router/end divice (air module)
1.Use XCTU, choose "ROUTER API MODE" or "END DEVICE API MODE" and write to the module. Enable "JV".(disable it is also ok)
2.Set the "PAN ID" the same as the coordinator.
3.Set the 64-bit destination address as the coordinator's 64-bit serial number or just set it as "0x0000000000000000".
4.Set baud rate to 57600.
